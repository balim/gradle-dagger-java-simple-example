# daggertest
This repository was created as an example how to build java project with dagger dependency injection using gradle.
For now it only works with 'com.google.dagger:dagger:2.2' i was unable to find out why version 2.3 crashes. As soon as I will solve problem with version 2.3 I will post update.
